#     [IMPLEMENT ME]
#         1. This class must derive from class Bank
#         2. Create a constructor for this class that initializes a class
#            variable `bal` to 1000
#         3. Implement the basicinfo() function so that it prints "This is the 
#            Swiss Bank" and returns a string with "Swiss Bank: " (don't forget
#            the space after the colon) followed by the current bank balance.

#            For example, if self.bal = 80, then it would return "Swiss Bank: 80"

#         4. Implement withdraw so that it takes one argument (in addition to
#            self) that is an integer which represents the amount to be withdrawn
#            from the bank. Deduct the withdrawn amount from the bank bal, print 
#            the withdrawn amount ("Withdrawn amount: {amount}"), print the new
#            balance ("New Balance: {self.bal}"), and return the new balance.

#            Note: Make sure to verify that there is enough money to withdraw!  
#                  If amount is greater than balance, then do not deduct any 
#                  money from the class variable `bal`. Instead, print a 
#                  statement saying `"Insufficient funds"`, and return the 
#                  original account balance instead.
